# Ruff Day Dogspo

Ruff Day Dogspo is a Ruby application built using Sinatra. 
It provides the user with a random picture of a dog using [TheDogAPI](https://thedogapi.com/) along with a motivational quote that contains a dog pun or reference. The goal was to provide a light experience that could brighten someone's mood.
The color palette was generated using [realtimecolors.com](realtimecolors.com) and the font was sourced from [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Alegreya). 

Future plans for the app include potentially integrating Petfinder's API to display adoptable dogs with the aim being to help more pets find forever homes. :)
